# Crystal-Collector
A web based game that the user has to use crystals to add numbers to a total random number. This site is built with html, css, and javascript which uses the jquery library.
This single page website displays four crystals each with a hidden value. Each time the user clicks on a crystal that value is added to a current total. The objective is to match the current total with the goal amount. When that goal is reached the crystals hidden values are reset and a new goal amount is assigned.
